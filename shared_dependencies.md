11. Vectorizer: The vectorizer.py file will define the functions for creating word vectors. These functions will be used in the document_processor.py and in the similarity_analyzer.py.

12. Cleaner: The cleaner.py file will define the functions for cleaning the data. These functions will be used in the document_processor.py.

13. Transformer: The transformer.py file will define the functions for transforming the data using the pretrained model. These functions will be used in the document_processor.py.

14. Requirements: The requirements.txt file will list all the Python packages required for the application. This file is used for setting up the environment.

15. README: The README.md file will provide instructions for installing and using the application. This file is used by the end users.
